The CSS property `calc()` might produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 20%);` will not behave as you might think. The percentage is calculated relative to the parent element's width before the subtraction.
